📈 Neural-Trade-RobinhoodA full-stack algorithmic trading platform that automates technical analysis and machine learning strategies on Robinhood. This system features a "Strategy Tournament" engine that logs the performance of multiple algorithms (Trend Following, Mean Reversion, Gradient Boosting) into a PostgreSQL database to statistically determine the best trading logic for different market regimes.🏗️ Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.13+Trading API: robin_stocks (Robinhood), yfinance (Data Feeds)Data Science: pandas, pandas_ta, numpy, scikit-learnDatabase: PostgreSQLBackend Framework: Flask (for dashboard and API endpoints)🚀 Key Features1. Multi-Strategy ArchitectureThe bot does not rely on a single algorithm. It supports a "Squad" of strategies:The Trend Surfer: Uses 200-day SMA logic to capture long-term bull runs.The Rubber Band: Uses Bollinger Band Reversion to trade sideways/choppy markets (e.g., NIO).The ML Sniper: (Experimental) Uses Gradient Boosting & Random Forest to predict short-term moves based on volume and momentum.2. Live Trading EngineSafety First: Checks available cash (not margin) and reserves a buffer before every trade.Regime Detection: Automatically detects if a stock is in a "Bull" or "Bear" phase to switch strategies.Execution: Places fractional share orders directly via the Robinhood API.3. 📊 Performance Analysis & Database LoggingCrucially, this project does not just "fire and forget." It stores detailed analytics of every decision into PostgreSQL for audit and refinement.The Data Pipeline:Daily Prediction Log: Every morning, the system runs all strategies (even the inactive ones) and logs their "vote" (Buy/Sell/Hold) to the database.Outcome Tagging: A scheduled cron job runs 24 hours later to fetch the actual stock movement and updates the previous day's log.Statistical Scoring: Queries run against the DB to calculate real-time Sharpe Ratios, Precision, and Drawdown for each strategy.💾 Database SchemaThe application uses a relational schema to track model drift and accuracy over time.strategy_logs TableStores the raw decision from every model, every day.ColumnTypeDescriptionidSERIALPrimary KeytimestampTIMESTAMPTime of analysistickerVARCHAR(10)e.g., "NIO", "NVDA"strategy_nameVARCHAR(50)e.g., "Trend_SMA200", "ML_GradientBoost"signalVARCHAR(10)"BUY", "SELL", "HOLD"confidenceFLOAT0.0 - 1.0 (For ML models)market_priceFLOATPrice at the time of signalperformance_metrics TableUsed for the "Tournament" scoring.ColumnTypeDescriptionlog_idINTForeign Key to strategy_logsactual_return_1dFLOAT% Change of stock next dayactual_return_1wFLOAT% Change of stock next weekis_correctBOOLEANDid the signal match the market direction?🛠️ Installation & Setup1.
